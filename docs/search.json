The Distribution of Life-Cycle Returns\nto Political Office with Jens Olav Dahlgaard and Nicolai\nKristensen. Under review. Working paper version here\nWe estimate the economic returns to winning office focusing on close\nwinning and losing candidates running for Danish national elections. We\ndevote special attention to 1) effect heterogeneity among candidates\nwith different pre-office income potentials and 2) the timing of returns\nto office, as some economic consequences of holding office occur\nimmediately when entering office while others occur later in life.\n\nPolitical Ambitions and Workplace Harassment – How Gender and\nVictimization Shape Political Candidates’ Preferences for Power, Time,\nMoney and Work Environments with Lene Holm Pedersen.

We\ndo this by focusing on local elections, where a woman marginally wins a\nseat over a man competing for the same seat, and estimate what this\nmeans to the composition of the future candidate pools and thus how it\nshapes the supply of political candidates.\n\nThe Career Rewards of Being Part-time Politician\nI estimate how holding a part-time political office affect income\nand civil career of Danish local councilors. Concerning the latter, I\nspecifically investigate what being a local councilor do to the\ncouncilors labour supply and probability of being promoted in their\noutside job.\n\n\n\n",
