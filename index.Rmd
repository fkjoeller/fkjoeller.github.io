Welcome to my website and thanks for stopping by!

I am an incoming postdoctoral researcher on the research project Origins of Descriptive Representation [ODER](https://www.carlsbergfondet.dk/en/Forskningsaktiviteter/Bevillingsstatistik/Bevillingsoversigt/CF22_0819_Frederik-Hjorth), which is funded by the Carlsberg Foundation and led by [Frederik Hjorth](https://fghjorth.github.io/). In the project, we use machine learning to digitize all Danish elections at the candidate level since the constitution in 1849. Next, we investigate how voters and parties in the early Danish democracy react to the the initial representation of women and workers.

From 2019-2023 I have been a PhD Fellow at [Department of Political Science, University of Copenhagen](https://politicalscience.ku.dk/). I submitted my PhD thesis on August 31st entitled "More Than A Job? Essays on Public Officeholders' Rewards and Representation" and am now waiting to defend it. In short, the dissertation concern political careers and analyse this from a societal point of view; who do we get?, and from the politicians' point of view; what do they get? My supervisors have been [Lene Holm Pedersen](https://politicalscience.ku.dk/staff/Academic_staff/?pure=en/persons/16215) (primary) and [Jens Olav Dahlgaard](https://jodahlgaard.com/) (secondary). During my PhD, I have had research stays at [Copenhagen Business School](https://www.cbs.dk/en/research/departments-and-centres/department-of-international-economics-government-and-business) and [Harvard University](https://gov.harvard.edu).

My research interests relate to the composition and dynamics of the political class, and how political systems intentionally and unintentionally shape who we get as officeholders and how they behave. My research rely on quantitative methods, and I draw inference by deploying various forms of quasi-experiments and traditional experiments.
