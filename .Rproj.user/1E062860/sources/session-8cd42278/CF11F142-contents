### Work in progress 

__Reward or Punishment? The Distribution of Life-Cycle Returns to Political Office__ with Jens Olav Dahlgaard and Nicolai Kristensen. Conditionally accepted in *Political Science Research & Methods*. Working paper version [here](https://www.iza.org/publications/dp/15274/reward-or-punishment-the-distribution-of-life-cycle-returns-to-political-office)


<!--* We estimate the economic returns to winning office focusing on close winning and losing candidates running for Danish national elections. We devote special attention to 1) effect heterogeneity among candidates with different pre-office income potentials and 2) the timing of returns to office, as some economic consequences of holding office occur immediately when entering office while others occur later in life.-->

__The Gendered Cost of Politics__ with Lene Holm Pedersen. Accepted in *British Journal of Political Science*.

<!--* We investigate political candidates' preferences for different job attributes of holding office using a conjoint-choice experiment fielded among the political candidates in the Danish municipal election in November 2021.-->

__What Happens When Women Win Elections? The Electoral Returns to Increased Representation of Women__ with Benjamin Egerod, Lene Holm Pedersen and Jens Olav Dahlgaard. Resubmitted to *Journal of Politics*

<!--* We investigate if the election of a woman for office foster female representation in future elections and beyond the candidate herself. We do this by focusing on local elections, where a woman marginally wins a seat over a man competing for the same seat, and estimate what this means to the composition of the future candidate pools and thus how it shapes the supply of political candidates.-->

__Government Ideology and Gender Equality in Public Sector Career Progression__ with Lasse Aaskoven and Benjamin Egerod.

<!--* Relying on granular data of the universe of Danish civil servants, we estimate how women’s career progression in the Danish bureaucracy depend on the ideology of the government in office.-->

__The Career Rewards of Being Part-time Politician__
