Welcome to my website and thanks for stopping by!

I am postdoctoral researcher at [Department of Political Science, University of Copenhagen](https://politicalscience.ku.dk/) on the research project Origins of Descriptive Representation [ODER](https://www.carlsbergfondet.dk/en/Forskningsaktiviteter/Bevillingsstatistik/Bevillingsoversigt/CF22_0819_Frederik-Hjorth). The project is funded by the Carlsberg Foundation and led by [Frederik Hjorth](https://fghjorth.github.io/). In the project, we use machine learning to digitize all Danish elections at the candidate level since the constitution in 1849 and investigate the representation of women and workers throughout Denmark's democratic history.

I received my PhD degree in December 2023 from [Department of Political Science, University of Copenhagen](https://politicalscience.ku.dk/). My dissertation is titled "More Than A Job? Essays on Public Officeholders' Rewards and Representation" and examines political careers and analyse them from a societal point of view; 'who do we get?', and from the politicians' point of view; 'what do they get?'. You can read and download the dissertation [here](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/8ryz82c7kr886x3uti32y/Kjoeller2023morethanajob.pdf?rlkey=6co7miy1a5h1rid4dxzh41wdy&dl=0). My PhD supervisors was [Lene Holm Pedersen](https://politicalscience.ku.dk/staff/Academic_staff/?pure=en/persons/16215) (primary) and [Jens Olav Dahlgaard](https://jodahlgaard.com/) (secondary). During my PhD, I have been visiting researcher at [Copenhagen Business School](https://www.cbs.dk/en/research/departments-and-centres/department-of-international-economics-government-and-business) and [Harvard University](https://gov.harvard.edu).

My research interests relate to the composition and dynamics of the political class, and how political systems intentionally and unintentionally shape who we get as officeholders and how they behave. My research rely on quantitative methods, and I draw inference by deploying various forms of quasi-experiments and traditional experiments.
